# firstGraphQL
This repo aims to give users an easy introduction to GraphQL. 
Each Branch will be a progression of the last example in the medium write up so readers can refer back to previous code if errors occur.
The purpose of this is to create a GraphQL Schema from scratch, query dummy data, then query async data from an external source.
Also check the package.json for nodemon and db.json configuration. 
The goal is to connect this GraphQL backend to a React-Native front-end.
